This project offers a digital solution to connect street vendors with their customers, providing an online platform that facilitates efficient communication and interaction. Here's how it works:

1. **For Customers:**
   - Customers can easily search and locate nearby street vendors through the website.
   - They can view vendor profiles, including product listings and detailed descriptions of their offerings.
   - Customers can send requests to vendors to access their contact details for direct communication.

2. **For Street Vendors:**
   - Vendors can showcase their products on the platform to reach a wider audience.
   - They have the ability to manage customer requests by accepting or denying them based on their preferences.

This platform simplifies interactions, increases vendor visibility, and makes it convenient for customers to access street-side businesses, creating a win-win situation for both parties.
